### Instructions
- a1_finetune.py is the main file to run. It will train the model and save the model to a file. The model will be saved to the same directory.
- a1_test.py is the file to run to test the model. It will load the model from the file and test it on the test set.
- deshitdataset.py will organize the dataset into a format that can be used by the model, namely a train, validation, and test set of 80%, 10%, and 10% of the data respectively.
